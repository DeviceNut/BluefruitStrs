BluefruitStrs Arduino Library
================================================================

This library was originally a reworked version of Adafruit's Arduino library for their Bluefruit LE modules found here:

https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_BluefruitLE_nRF51

It has been now completely reworked to just support the reading and writing of strings over Bluetooth LE. It was rewritten to fix stability issues that were found, to reduce its memory footprint, and to allow more robust error handling.

It is used in all PixelNut! products from Devicenut that use bluetooth communications for user control.

The following devices are supported from Adafruit:

Bluefruit LE SPI Friend
Bluefruit LE Micro
Feather 32u4 Bluefruit LE

After downloading, rename folder to 'BluefruitStrs' and install in the Arduino Libraries folder.
